# CASA0016_Dangerous-gas-detector
My project is a dangerous gas detector specially designed for use in mines. The gas detector uses 4 Arduino MQ gas sensors to detect four common dangerous gases in mines (Methane, Carbon monoxide, Hydrogen, Flammable gas), and After detecting that the gas content exceeds the safe range, LED lights and buzzers are used to warn users. The gas detector has an OLED display to display the gas data detected by the MQ sensors.
